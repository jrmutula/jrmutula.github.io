OOP makes your program more flexible and understandable.
In procedural programming; programmer asks him/herself, "What does this program have to do?"(The old way)
In OOP the question is, "What things are in this program?"(The new way"

OOP code is a lot neater and organised, because if you want to add a new capability to an object, you just create a new function without touching any of the old code.

OOP requires less code to get things done, because of a concept called inheritance.

A class is a blue print that describes how to build many objects

**How to create an Object**

*className objectToCreate = new className();*

for example:

car dodge = new car();

**Methods and Instance Variables**

You use the dot operator (.) to access a method or variable that lies in a newly created object.

for example:

dodge.engine  or  dodge.getGas

By encapsulating your code you are preventing it from getting accidentally edited.

**What Is Encapsulation?**

Create two methods for each variable you define.

One of those methods returns the value. (Start this method with the word *get*)

The other changes the value of that variable. (Start this method with the word *set*)

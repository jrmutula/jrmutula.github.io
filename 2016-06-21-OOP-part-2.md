##Why Inheritance Is Good.

1. Decreases duplicate code.
2. Eliminates looking for what code needs to be changed.
3. Avoids breaking previously working code.
4. Simplifies your overall code.

**carA dodge = new carA();**  *tells the computer the following:

**carA dodge** : Tells the computer a variable of type carA named dodge is being created.

**new carA** : Sets aside space in memory for a new carA object.

The **dodge** variable and the **carA** object both are the same. **dodge** is just a variable name that points to the **carA** object in memory.

**Polymorphism** provides you with a way to write code that doesnt depend on types.

An **interface** is a shell that provides the names of all the variables and methods, but no code.
